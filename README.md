👋 Hi, I’m Rishabbh, Data Scientist and Consultant, having experience across multiple industries like Retail, Manufacturing, FMCG etc.

👀 I’m interested in sharing, learning and exploring with open source communities and motivated to create projects pertaining to ML/DL, research work and consulting assignments.

🌱 I’m currently learning lanugauge models to solve NLP downstream tasks like summarization, Q&A, NLU/NLG intent classification, NER, email classification, sentence/document similarity, information retrieval using tfidf etc.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Deep learning and ML related projects.
